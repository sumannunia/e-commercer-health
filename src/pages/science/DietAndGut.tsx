Including fermented foods and probiotics, along with healthy fats and antioxidants, helps promote digestion, reduce inflammation, and enhance immune function. It's also important to limit processed foods, added sugars, and artificial sweeteners, which can harm gut bacteria. Managing stress and eating mindfully can further improve gut health. Additionally, incorporating polyphenols, spices like turmeric and ginger, and resistant starches from foods like beans and potatoes can support gut function. Maintaining adequate vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 intake, as well as following diets like the Mediterranean diet, can also contribute to gut well-being.
